# Recommendations

- Investigate failing tests in `crawl4ai-adapter` and integration handlers to ensure stability.
- Consider configuring CI to catch missing environment variable `PATH` issues by setting PATH in shell profile.
- Enhance error handling in Crawl4AI adapter to avoid `Cannot access 'data' before initialization` issues.
